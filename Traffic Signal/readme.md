# üö¶ Basic Traffic Signal with Arduino and LCD

This project demonstrates a simple **traffic signal system** using an Arduino, three LEDs, and an LCD screen. The lights cycle through green, yellow, and red, with real-time status display on the LCD.

## ‚ö° How It Works

- The Arduino cycles through **Green ‚Üí Yellow ‚Üí Red** lights.
- Each phase lasts for **5 seconds** (can be adjusted in code).
- The **LCD shows the active light and a status message**.
- Serial Monitor outputs system status for debugging.


## üì¶ Usage

1. Connect the LEDs and LCD as shown above.
2. Upload the sketch to your Arduino via the IDE.
3. Open the Serial Monitor (**9600 baud**) for status logs.
4. Watch the LEDs and LCD cycle in real time!
